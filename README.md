# Super Mario in basic JS/jQuery

Working on getting 

1. npm install
2. gem install jekyll

All work is done in the "dev" folder and is built out into the "build" folder. 

All my HTML is generated using Jekyll - specifically the [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating engine. SASS is used for CSS preprocessing and JS resides in functions live in dev/js/app.js :)

Eventually, I'll be using webpack once it get's more complicated...
